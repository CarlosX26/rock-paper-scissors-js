# rock-paper-scissors-js
the idea here was to reproduce the game rock, paper, scissors, it was a lot of fun to develop this project, developing games requires a little more logic, but in this case it was not difficult to create the game here, everything went as expected, here I used html, css and javaScript with OOP, the result made me very happy, after seeing the project working, we feel a very good feeling, i love programming.
